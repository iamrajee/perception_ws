# YOLO + SORT/DEEP SORT for ROS (not maintained anymore)
Tracker ROS node (sort and deep sort) using darknet_ros (YOLOv3).
Detected bounding boxes from YOLO are used by the sort tracker.  
This has been done using ROS Kinetic, python2 and OpenCV2. If you need a modern ros wrapper for SORT, you should use newer versions of ROS, OpenCV and python.
### Help needed
The branch ```ros-noetic``` is a tentative to make it compatible with Python3, ROS Noetic and OpenCV4


## Docker installation
Go to the docker folder and run the following:   
```./build_image.sh ```   
```./run_container.sh path_to_your_workspace```   
You can use the docker container to build and run the code.     
Clone the repositories outside the container and mount the volume with the workspace to the container.

## Installation
In order to install darknet_ros, clone the latest version into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd catkin_workspace/src
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros.git
    cd ../
    catkin build darknet_ros
In order to install sort_track, clone this repository in your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS

    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/ilyas95/sort-deepsort-yolov3-ROS
    catkin build sort_track
   
## How to use  
Remember to source your workspace in every new terminal window by using

    source ~/catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash
Run darknet_ros detector (For my project I used mainly YOLOv3-tiny but it should work for the other YOLOs)
    
    roslaunch darknet_ros yolo_v3-tiny.launch
If you use the computer camera, you may need to install usb_cam ROS package and run this before running darknet_ros node:

    roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
If you still have Waiting for image. message, try to see in the file ros.yaml what is the camera topic
Then you can choose between:
- SORT  


To run:

    roslaunch sort_track sort.launch
    
    
- DEEP SORT


Before running go to catkin_workspace/src/sort_track/src and open track_deep.py
In line 90, modify model_filename to your directory
To run:

    roslaunch sort_track sort_deep.launch
IMPORTANT!! Before running the tracker nodes, you have to make the python scripts executable.
For SORT, go to catkin_workspace/src/sort-deepsort-yolov3-ROS/sort_track/src and make track.py executable.
For DEEP SORT, go to the same folder and make track_deep.py executable.
